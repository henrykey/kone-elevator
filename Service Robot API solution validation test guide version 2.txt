There is a list of actions returned in the action command but if other outside this list is used, users should be instructed to use the correct value7This is to handle situations that previously accepted action is now disabled, and users need to be informed properly to switch their action selection.8There comes with the action file description of actions, if used incorrectly, users should be informed and directed. For example, if making a landing call at the last floor and selecting an action indication going down, as this is not physically possible, such error will occur.9To get maximum door open time so that robot can enter lift, use of delay is important. For example, normal elevator door is opened for 5 seconds but robot needs more time to enter the elevator, with delay data, robot can get more time to enter the elevator.10The delay is maximum 30 sec, for example if robot want to set 25 second and then set 40sec for the delay, this will cause call to be rejected.11This is for building setup where two elevator rides are needed to get to the destination. For example if robot is on floor 5 and wants to go to floor 15, in the building elevator A can serve from floor 1 to 10 and elevator B can serve from floor 10 to 20 (in a 20 floors building), and the robot makes a call with source 5 and destination 15. First elevator A will come to floor 5 and take the robot to floor 10. In this case, the robot needs to know that it is at floor 10 and not 15 and also that it needs to make another call with source 10 and destination 15 in order to use elevator B to get to its final destination. Else robot will be on floor 10 with to understanding what to do next.12For buildings with elevators that have two doors (front and rear), if a call is made from front side to rear side of the same floor for example floor 5 front and floor 5 rear for both front and rear door to open and robot can drive through the elevator, this is not allowed and will result in call rejection.13If the solution user makes a call to the same floor where it is located or for example it is on floor 5 and wants to go to floor 10 but set that it is on floor 10 and want to go to floor 10, this will result in call rejection.14In a situation that there is more than one elevator in the elevator lobby, it is possible to specify which of the elevator to serve the call being made. This use case provides the chance to selector among the elevator with the correct parameter.15This helps to cancel a call made that is no longer needed16For a building with 20 floors, if the destination is set to 21 or above, for example robot is on floor 5 and want to go to floor 11 but set destination to floor 21 instead, this will result in error and robot needs to know of the error and make correct call.17For a building with 20 floors, if the source is set to 21 or above, for example robot is on floor 5 and set that it is on floor 25, this will result in error and robot needs to know of the error and make correct call.18If the robot makes a call to the same floor where it is located or for example it is on floor 5 and wants to go to floor 10 but set that it is on floor 10 and want to go to floor 10, this will result in call rejection.19For a building with 20 floors, if the source is set to 21 and destination is set to 25 or above, for example solution user is on floor 5 and want to go to floor 11 but set the source to 21 and destination to floor 25 instead, this will result in error and solution user needs to know of the error and make correct call.20When there is mistake in building id where the robot is located for example if building id is abcdefg and robot makes a call to building cdefgab then call will be rejected.1Explain how it is done.In a physical building, there can be multiple groups for example in a building lobby to the left can be elevator West group and to the right elevator East group, when the robot is in the lobby and riding towards the West group elevator, it has to know about both groups and about the current group it is located so as to make call to the West group and not to the East group.21Like above, this is to check making call to second group, for example while at the lobby and heading towards the East group elevator, robot should not make call to West group elevator.2Explain how it is done.This applies when building have access control system. For example, if access control system in a building specify where the robot can go and it specifies that the robot can only got to floors 5 Ð 10. How will the robot know about this limited access? The robot should connect to access control system and get this specific floor so that it knows that it can only go to floors 5 Ð 10.22Like above, robot connects to access control system and now knows it can only make call to floors 5 Ð 10. Calls to other floors by the robot must not be allowed. As the api doesnÕt prevent robot from making calls to other floors, the restriction must be done within the robot to follow the access control rules in the building.3Explain how it is done.This checks if robot is in the right building, for example if the robot is configured to work in Building 1 in a building complex and then moved to Building 2 to start operation, the robot must not be allowed to make calls to Building 1 and must identify itself to be in Building 2.23Like above this checks for example when robot is in Building 1 calls canÕt be made and when the robot is moved to Building 2 it is then able to make calls.4Explain how it is done.This handles for example when there is a turnstile in the building but no means to open and close the turnstile gate. If robot have system to open and close the gate when it goes through then specify it here. Else customer needs to find another system to control the gate.5Explain how it is done.If there is a building turnstile regardless how it is controlled, how can robot for example when before the turnstile it is prevented from making any call and when after the turnstile its calling ability is enabled. If robot is going to floor 5, while before the turnstile and tries to make a call, the call making is disabled and after going pasted the turnstile the call making is enabled and it can call floor 5.6Explain how it is done.If robot makes a call at regular interval, for example when entering or exiting an elevator lobby, how to determine based on robot driving direction that call should be made and if robot is leaving the elevator lobby, calling is prevented. If robot is going from floor 5 to floor 10, when driving in the direction to lobby of floor 5, call can be made but when driving away from lobby on floor 10 then call must be disabled.24Like above, this checks for example if calls are prevented before a turnstile while the robot is driving toward the elevator lobby and once the robot crosses the turnstile, elevator calling becomes active. It can be assumed that some other system like access control system will open the turnstile for the robot, so before the turnstile is opened and when robot is on floor 5 going to floor 10, call cant be made but after access control opens the turnstile and robot crosses, then call to floor 5 is possible.25Like above, this checks for example if calls are prevented before a turnstile while the robot is driving toward the elevator lobby, the robot is able to open the turnstile and once the robot crosses the turnstile, elevator calling becomes active. In this case, it can be assumed that robot / robot system will open the turnstile for the robot, so before the turnstile is opened and when robot is on floor 5 going to floor 10, call canÕt be made but after robot / robot system opens the turnstile and robot crosses, then call to floor 5 is possible.7Explain how it is done.This handles unwanted calls for example a call is already made and robot is waiting for the elevator in the lobby, while waiting, other calls should not be made. Meaning if robot is going from floor 5 to 10, and first call is made, while robot is waiting for elevator to come to floor 5, it should not make any more calls for floor 5 to 10.26Like above, this checks for example that calls are not made from floor 5 to floor 10 again while robot is still waiting for elevator A to come to floor 5.27Like above, this checks for example if calls are prevented before a turnstile while the solution user is walking toward the elevator lobby, the solution user can open the turnstile and once the solution user crosses the turnstile, elevator calling becomes active. In this case, it can be assumed that solution user / solution user system will open the turnstile for the solution user, so before the turnstile is opened and when solution user is on floor 5 going to floor 10, call canÕt be made but after solution user / solution user system opens the turnstile and solution user crosses, then call to floor 5 is possible.28This is like test 10. While test 10 accepts the possibility that from the robot, calls from source to destination can be manually selected, this checks for automatic calls and that automatic call is made for the right elevator group and no further calls made afterwards. for example while at the lobby and heading towards the East group elevator, robot should not make call to West group elevator automatically.29Like above, this checks for example that calls are not made from floor 5 to floor 10 again after solution user / solution user system opens the turnstile for passage while solution user is still waiting for elevator A to come to floor 530This checks for local lock error handling. for example if there is local lock on floor 5 and robot make a call setting it source to 5, it will reject the call. Robot should be able to handle the rejection.31This checks for local lock error handling. for example, if there is local lock on floor 5 and solution user make a call setting it source to 5, it will reject the call. Solution user should be able to handle the rejection.32reset injected error above and test again that all is fine33This checks how un-servable call is handled for example if calls is made from floor 5 to floor 10 but the call response is that no elevator can serve therefore call cancelled, how to handle such cancellation and make another call.34reset injected error above and test again that all is fine35This checks how un-servable call is handled for example if calls is made from floor 5 to floor 10 but the call status never changes, who to handle such freeze in communication. 36When a call is placed and the call fails, it is possible to ping the elevator to determine if the communication is alive before proceeding to making more calls. This pinging can stop once successful and call making resumes. 37reset injected error above and test again that all is fine.8Giving explanation how logs especially access call logs to different floors are stored.9This is to indicate if the cyber security self-test has been taken.10This is to indicate how communication between the robot and either an intermediate controller at site or own cloud backend is established for example with 4G or wifi when the robot is outside and inside the elevator car. As it is known that connectivity strengths drops when robot is inside the elevator car, how is this managed to ensure continuous control of the robot.1 (1) © 2021 KONE Corporation.
