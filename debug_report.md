## Authentication & Token Scope Validation

This section provides detailed information about OAuth2 token validation and scope verification. 
Token validation helps identify whether test failures are due to authentication/authorization issues rather than test script problems.

**No authentication data recorded for this session.**

### Expected Authentication Flow
1. **Token Request**: Client requests access token with specific scope
2. **Scope Validation**: Verify token contains required scope for operation  
3. **API Access**: Use validated token for WebSocket and REST API calls
4. **Error Handling**: Handle 401/403 errors with appropriate scope retry logic

**Recommendation**: Ensure authentication data is collected during test execution for better debugging capability.
