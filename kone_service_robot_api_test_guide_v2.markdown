## 2. Document Purpose

Ensuring the quality and security of a solution is every developer’s responsibility. This document gives guidance on evaluating the readiness of those solutions that use Service Robot API. Practical examples of the expected testing support you in the validation. You can also use this guide as a template for documenting test results.

The test environment used in these test scenarios has been designed to resemble an elevator setup in a building. Solution validation is needed before connecting a solution to KONE equipment.

## Explanation of the Flow items

| Flow | Explain how it is done                                                                                                                    |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **0** | This checks for example if robot is within acceptable proximity to the elevator to make a call. For example, it can be checked using the location information if robot is within 5 meters from the elevator, if yes, then call can be made, if no, then call should not be made. |
| **1** | This checks for example if robot is trying to make a call when the elevator is in fire mode or out of service mode, the call should be prevented. |
| **2** | This checks for example if robot is making calls at regular interval, for example every 10 seconds when moving towards an elevator lobby, it should make a call, but if moving away from the lobby, then call should be disabled. For example when before the turnstile it is prevented from making any call and when after the turnstile its calling ability is enabled. If robot is going to floor 5, while before the turnstile and tries to make a call, the call making is disabled and after going past the turnstile the call making is enabled and it can call floor 5. |
| **3** | This handles unwanted calls for example a call is already made and robot is waiting for the elevator in the lobby, while waiting, other calls should not be made. Meaning if robot is going from floor 5 to 10, and first call is made, while robot is waiting for elevator to come to floor 5, it should not make any more calls for floor 5 to 10. |
| **4** | Like above, this checks for example if calls are prevented before a turnstile while the robot is driving toward the elevator lobby and once the robot crosses the turnstile, elevator calling becomes active. It can be assumed that some other system like access control system will open the turnstile for the robot, so before the turnstile is opened and when robot is on floor 5 going to floor 10, call can't be made but after access control opens the turnstile and robot crosses, then call to floor 5 is possible. |
| **5** | Like above, this checks for example if calls are prevented before a turnstile while the robot is driving toward the elevator lobby, the robot is able to open the turnstile and once the robot crosses the turnstile, elevator calling becomes active. In this case, it can be assumed that robot / robot system will open the turnstile for the robot, so before the turnstile is opened and when robot is on floor 5 going to floor 10, call can’t be made but after robot / robot system opens the turnstile and robot crosses, then call to floor 5 is possible. |
| **6** | This handles unwanted calls for example a call is already made and robot is waiting for the elevator in the lobby, while waiting, other calls should not be made. Meaning if robot is going from floor 5 to 10, and first call is made, while robot is waiting for elevator to come to floor 5, it should not make any more calls for floor 5 to 10. |
| **7** | Like above, this checks for example that calls are not made from floor 5 to floor 10 again while robot is still waiting for elevator A to come to floor 5. |
| **8** | Like above, this checks for example if calls are prevented before a turnstile while the solution user is walking toward the elevator lobby, the solution user can open the turnstile and once the solution user crosses the turnstile, elevator calling becomes active. In this case, it can be assumed that solution user / solution user system will open the turnstile for the solution user, so before the turnstile is opened and when solution user is on floor 5 going to floor 10, call can’t be made but after solution user / solution user system opens the turnstile and solution user crosses, then call to floor 5 is possible. |
| **9** | This is like test 10. While test 10 accepts the possibility that from the robot, calls from source to destination can be manually selected, this checks for automatic calls and that automatic call is made for the right elevator group and no further calls made afterwards. for example while at the lobby and heading towards the East group elevator, robot should not make call to West group elevator automatically. |
| **10** | Like above, this checks for example that calls are not made from floor 5 to floor 10 again after solution user / solution user system opens the turnstile for passage while solution user is still waiting for elevator A to come to floor 5. |
| **11** | This checks for local lock error handling. for example if there is local lock on floor 5 and robot make a call setting it source to 5, it will reject the call. Robot should be able to handle the rejection. |
| **12** | This checks for local lock error handling. for example, if there is local lock on floor 5 and solution user make a call setting it source to 5, it will reject the call. Solution user should be able to handle the rejection. |
| **13** | reset injected error above and test again that all is fine |
| **14** | This checks how un-servable call is handled for example if calls is made from floor 5 to floor 10 but the call response is that no elevator can serve therefore call cancelled, how to handle such cancellation and make another call. |
| **15** | reset injected error above and test again that all is fine |
| **16** | This checks how un-servable call is handled for example if calls is made from floor 5 to floor 10 but the call status never changes, who to handle such freeze in communication. |
| **17** | When a call is placed and the call fails, it is possible to ping the elevator to determine if the communication is alive before proceeding to making more calls. This pinging can stop once successful and call making resumes. |
| **18** | reset injected error above and test again that all is fine. |
| **19** | Giving explanation how logs especially access call logs to different floors are stored. |
| **20** | This is to indicate if the cyber security self-test has been taken. |
| **21** | This is to indicate how communication between the robot and either an intermediate controller at site or own cloud backend is established for example with 4G or wifi when the robot is outside and inside the elevator car. As it is known that connectivity strengths drops when robot is inside the elevator car, how is this managed to ensure continuous control of the robot. |
